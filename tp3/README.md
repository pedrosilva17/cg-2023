## TP 3 Notes

- Having to clone the vertices according to the number of sides they are a part of in order to attribute the corresponding normal vector to them feels unintuitive, but understandable when taking the illumination procedure from WebGL into account.
- The `hexToRgbA()` function was invaluable to replicate the Tangram, as converting the colors from the image to the program manually would've been bothersome.
